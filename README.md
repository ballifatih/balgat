# balgat

balgat is meant to be simple, static, personla blogging base code for blog site.

The main focus:
  * static-html pages (client-side-scripts: no, server-side-scripts: unlikely)
  * easy-to-maintain (20+ years of use, easy to move, easy to develop, good distinction between data and the template ? )
  * secure to web vulnerabilities ( static html, no server-side scripts if possible)
  * easy to add new content ( does not have to be super-easy, but should not take more than few minutes)
  * I want even html-code to be stripped of useless stuff as much as possible (like not many get requests)
  * good directory structure would be nice ( for SEO, for later access -- we want this site to stay there 20+ years)
